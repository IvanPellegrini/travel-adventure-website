              <h4>Barcelona</h4>
              <p>
                The soul-caressing Spanish climate might set Barcelona up as an
                outdoor city, but its indoor activities have kudos, too. Find
                world-renowned museums that showcase artistic legends and rising
                stars, markets rich in local produce, and panoramic viewing

              <h4>Prague</h4>
              <p>
                A prosperous and bustling city, Prague now attracts more
                tourists than ever. But its picturesque downtown veils both a
                dark legacy and a resilient past.Even today, top attractions –
                including the famous Charles Bridge and the historic Prague
                Castle that has made the Czech capital so fascinating.

              <h4>Rome</h4>
              <p>
                It famously straddles seven hills, but Rome often feels like
                several cities. There's the ancient one, of course – the Rome of
                emperors and amphitheaters, still visible today. Then there's
                grand, baroque Rome, a city of immense squares, florid churches
                and fountains, each more spectacular than the next.

              <h4>Istanbul</h4>
              <p>
                Bridging East and West Istanbul possesses a richly complicated
                heritage. Once the capital of the Ottoman and Byzantine empires,
                city's prestigious history has left us with many monuments to
                cherish. Although Istanbul looks serene from afar, the
                atmosphere is wonderfully chaotic.

              <h4>Athens</h4>
              <p>
                Few cities rival Athens when it comes to historical importance.
                As the sun rises over the smooth marble monuments of the
                Acropolis and fills the cobblestone streets along its base, the
                people of Athens emerge from their homes and head to local
                markets or sidewalk games of chess.

              <p>
                One of the most visually arresting cities in Scandinavia,
                Stockholm is situated on an archipelago containing roughly
                30,000 islands that eventually lead to the Baltic Sea. Explore
                the various islands positioned throughout the city's vast amount
                of waterways, bays and rivers.

              <h4>Dublin</h4>
              <p>
                Like many modern cities, Dublin is a melting pot. Along with its
                traditional Irish culture, Dublin has been infiltrated by a host
                of glorious international influences. The city is the largest in
                Ireland, and its fast-growing immigrant population brings people
                from all over the world.

              <p>
                Iceland's capital and largest city is a prime home base for
                exploring many of the country's most treasured natural wonders,
                such as the Golden Circle. There are also gushing waterfalls,
                awe-inspiring geysers, and wide open spaces filled with
                Icelandic horses and sheep.
